# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a FastAPI-based machine learning application that analyzes machine downtime data from CIMCO AS software. The system will predict potential machine issues, optimize maintenance schedules, and identify efficiency patterns to improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and reduce unexpected downtime.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Ingestion and Management

**User Story:** As a manufacturing operations manager, I want to upload and manage machine data from CIMCO systems, so that I can have a centralized repository of machine performance information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN machine data is uploaded via CSV or JSON THEN the system SHALL validate data format and structure
2. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the upload and provide specific error messages
3. WHEN valid data is processed THEN the system SHALL store machine records, job data, operator information, and downtime records in the database
4. WHEN large datasets are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them in batches to prevent timeouts
5. IF duplicate records are detected THEN the system SHALL handle them according to configured deduplication rules

### Requirement 2: Machine Performance Prediction

**User Story:** As a maintenance supervisor, I want to predict when machines will require maintenance, so that I can schedule proactive maintenance and avoid unexpected downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN historical machine data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL predict next maintenance requirement timing with >85% accuracy
2. WHEN setup time patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL predict probability of setup time exceeding defined thresholds
3. WHEN machine performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify equipment failure risk and alert operators
4. WHEN job scheduling is requested THEN the system SHALL provide optimal scheduling recommendations based on predicted performance
5. IF insufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL indicate prediction confidence levels

### Requirement 3: Real-time Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a production floor supervisor, I want real-time visibility into machine performance and efficiency metrics, so that I can make immediate operational decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN machines are operating THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring through WebSocket connections
2. WHEN efficiency metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL display machine utilization rates, OEE scores, and downtime categorization
3. WHEN critical downtime events occur THEN the system SHALL send automated alerts to designated personnel
4. WHEN performance data is requested THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms for prediction queries
5. IF model accuracy degrades THEN the system SHALL detect model drift and trigger retraining workflows

### Requirement 4: Data Analysis and Reporting

**User Story:** As a plant manager, I want comprehensive reports and analytics on machine performance trends, so that I can make strategic decisions about equipment and operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN report generation is requested THEN the system SHALL create daily, weekly, and custom period reports
2. WHEN historical trends are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in downtime categories, operator performance, and machine efficiency
3. WHEN correlation analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify relationships between different downtime types and operational factors
4. WHEN reports are exported THEN the system SHALL support PDF and Excel formats
5. IF custom dashboard views are needed THEN the system SHALL provide configurable dashboard creation capabilities

### Requirement 5: Optimization and Recommendations

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want optimization recommendations for production schedules and maintenance planning, so that I can maximize equipment efficiency and minimize costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN production scheduling is optimized THEN the system SHALL recommend job sequences that minimize setup times and maximize throughput
2. WHEN maintenance planning is performed THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal maintenance schedules based on predicted failure patterns
3. WHEN operator assignments are evaluated THEN the system SHALL recommend operator-machine pairings for optimal performance
4. WHEN inventory planning is needed THEN the system SHALL predict part requirements based on job schedules and maintenance needs
5. IF optimization parameters change THEN the system SHALL recalculate recommendations and notify relevant stakeholders

### Requirement 6: System Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be reliable, scalable, and maintainable, so that it can support continuous manufacturing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 200ms for 95% of requests
3. WHEN system updates are deployed THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments through CI/CD pipelines
4. WHEN data backup is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain automated database backups with point-in-time recovery
5. IF system failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and monitoring for rapid troubleshooting

### Requirement 7: Model Management and Training

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to manage machine learning models and their training processes, so that I can continuously improve prediction accuracy and adapt to changing operational patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL use cross-validation strategies appropriate for time series data
2. WHEN model performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL track accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE, classification accuracy) over time
3. WHEN hyperparameter optimization is performed THEN the system SHALL use automated tuning methods (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV)
4. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL support model versioning and rollback capabilities
5. IF model retraining is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain models using updated data while maintaining service availability
